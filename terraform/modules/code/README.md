# Important decision

Because from now I neither have an AWS Builder ID account and due to it I'm not allowed
to create a CodeCatalyst space yet nor a CodeCommit repository, I'll proceed with the
GitHub actions linked with my AWS Account Credentials and AWS ECR Credentials.

For more information about why I don't have access to CodeCatalyst and CodeCommit,
please see the first lines of `code_catalyst.tf` and `code_commit.tf` files.
